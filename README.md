**Description**
 
Draw Chatâ„¢  is an exciting social experience that will allow users to draw pictures back and forth with their friends. The application will have a kahoot-like format where users will enter themselves into a game with other users. Once all users join the game, and indicate that they are ready to begin, one member will be prompted to draw something from a list that we will provide. The other users will receive updates of the drawers drawing every one second, and be prompted to keep guessing until they guess correctly or the 30 second timer runs out.

If a guessing user guesses correctly, they will receive a score based on how long it took them to input the correct answer. Once the timer has run out, all users will be brought to a page where they are asked if they would like to play again or end the game. Should they select to continue the game, they will be brought back to the start page where all of the users will be displayed. When they begin again from there, a new user will be given the drawing responsibility. Otherwise, if they select to end the game, they
will be brought to a page that will display the scores of all of the users.
